# Learning and Knowledge management

Some techniques and ideas on how to manage knowledge, learn things, and retain
the information:

- Zettlekasten - note taking and knowledge mgmt. Take notes in your own words,
  break them down into "zettles", permanent vs fleeting notes, categorization
  system with numbering
- Spaced Repetition
- Essay writing
- Testing/quizzes
- Handwriting notes are better for learning than typing

Thinking about how to incorporate all these into my own system:

1. Capture notes on notecards when reading, indexing the source
2. Create permanent notes from those, storing with some form of cross linking /
   hierarchical structure - Still sorting this out.. right now I'm thinking of creating folders for
   categories, and can create sub folders when needed. Or figure out a way to
   encode the numbered category into metadata. - One of the Zk resources suggests that using a physical Zk system is
   superior, one reason is that you have to review and find the right place to
   store new data. Can I still create some friction when storing it digitally
   by requiring a manual number assignment and crosslink?
3. Use FSRS to schedule reviews of the material
   - Can I use LLM to generate quizzes/questions for reviews, then mark them as
     reviewed using SRS algo?
   - LLM should pull from source zettles, but track the 'card' as reviewed as
     metadata in the zettle
   - LLM should "grade" the answers, and guide to the correct one. Inspiration from math academy.
4. Find time on a regular basis to write mini essays about things I've learned
   about and synthesize. Possibly tutorials or relating a topic back to networking.
