# Linear Algebra part 1 - Vectors

What little exposure I've had to Linear Algebra in the past has mainly focused on viewing matrices as way to represent and solve a set of linear equations. But after viewing the first few videos of 3b1b's excellent video series and reading the first few chapters of some books, I've come to realize that its much more interesting to take a geometric view of it.

For the purposes of this discussion, I'll think of vectors as an arrow of a certain size and direction pointing away from the origin. The values provide the end point of the vector. For instance the vector \[1,2\] would be represented like this:

A vector space is a set of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars (regular numbers).

This makes sense how the databases used for RAG are 'Vector Databases' as they store these vector values, and position them in vector space, so we can search for things based on their similarity or closeness in vector space.
