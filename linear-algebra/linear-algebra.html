<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Linear algebra provides tools for solving and manipulating vectors
and matrices. Beginning with vectors that define a length and direction,
represented by a list of numbers, and more abstractly follow rules for
vector addition and multiplying by a scalar. Vectors can be combined
using linear combinations, essentially adding and scaling vectors to
create a new vector. and can be used to represent a linear equation.
From a networking perspective from a AI/ML perspective</p>

<h2 id="vectors">Vectors</h2>
<p>Vectors are a fundamental concept in linear algebra and can have
multiple interpretations from physics, to computer science, and
mathematics. For our purposes we will use assume they represent a line
that begins at the origin, and goes to the point represented by the
vector. In mathematics, a vector is defined as an element of a <a
href="#vector-space">Vector Space</a>, and is defined by their
operations (see below). They are represented<span

class="sidenote">I am using Pandoc and LaTeX to render some of this

braces matrix styles are useful latex options.<br />
<br />
</span></span> like this:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2
\end{bmatrix}\)</span></p>
<p>The primary vector operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>vector addition - combining vectors end to end</li>
<li>multiplication by a scalar - scales the vector</li>
</ul>
<p>A vector exists outside of its coordinates and is not the same as its
coordinates Vectors can represent different coordinates in different
coordinate spaces through <a href="#linear-transformation">Linear
Transformation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#orthogonal-vectors">Orthogonal Vectors</a> with length

<h3 id="basis-vector">Basis Vector</h3>
<p>Basis vectors of a <a href="#vector-space">Vector Space</a> are a set
of <a href="#linearly-independent">Linearly Independent</a> vectors that
span the entire vector space, so they can express all the vectors in the
space. Since a vector space can have infinitely many vectors, using the
basis allows us to succinctly define and work with the vector space.</p>
<p>Given S subset of V, S is basis of V if</p>
<ul>
<li>S is LI</li>
<li>Span(S) = V</li>
<li>The elements of S are basis vectors</li>
<li>MoML pg 57</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="orthonormal-basis">Orthonormal Basis</h3>
<p>The standard basis would have a vector with 1 in each dimension. For
example <span class="math inline">\([1,0] [0,1]\)</span>. Changing the
basis does not actually change the vectors, but changes how they are
described.</p>
<p>Some reasons you may want to change the basis:</p>

<li>Triangle inequality = ||x+y|| &lt;= ||x||+||y||</li>

<h2 id="matrices">Matrices</h2>
<p>A matrix can be used to represent a series of linear equations. For
example given the following linear equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x + 2y = 5
3x + 4y = 11
\]</span></p>
<p>This becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 \\
3 &amp; 4 &amp; 11 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Any matrix can be geometrically viewed as a <a
href="#linear-transformation">Linear Transformation</a>. In fact, you
can create a 1:1 correspondence between a set of linear transformations
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and a matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for a given basis. From this
perspective a matrix is simply a representation of linear
transformations relative to a given basis.</p>
<h3 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h3>
<ul>
<li>Has columns that are [Orthonormal], resulting in A^(-1) = A^T, which
makes calculating the inverse efficient</li>
<li>Results in a rotation when viewed as a linear transformation, the
transformation is done relative to an <a
href="#orthonormal-basis">Orthonormal Basis</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-transformation">Linear Transformation</h3>
<p>By multiplying a vector by a matrix, we can perform transformations
of the vector. So geometrically a matrix represents a linear transform
of a vector.</p>
<p>Linear Transformations have the key properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lines remain lines, they don’t become curves</li>
<li>Origin stays the same</li>
<li>Grid lines stay equally spaced and parallel</li>
</ol>
<p>The transformation can be represented by a matrix describes of how
the basis vector changes from the domain to the codomain. This creates a
1:1 correspondence between the transformation functions and the matrix
which represents it. The values of the matrix are the images of the
domain in the codomain. It can be compared to the allegory of caves,
where the transformation is the reality and the matrix is the shadow
representation of the transformation.</p>

<p>A matrix is injective (one-to-one) if every input maps to a distinct

are covered. In other words, every input gets mapped to one output, with
no overlaps. If you know that x -&gt; y, then if something else maps to
y it must be equal to x. Injective also means <span
class="math inline">\(ker(A) = \{0\}\)</span> the Kernel is equal to the
zero vector. A matrix can only be injective if it is square or “tall” (m
&gt;= n). More formally:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span> is injective
if:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<h3 id="surjective">Surjective</h3>
<p>A matrix is surjective (onto) if every vector in the co-domain has a

of Eigenvector and value</a> One of the motivations for finding the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors is it can simplify the linear
transformation such as finding a diagonal matrix equivalent (<span
class="math inline">\(A=PDP^{-1}\)</span>)of the matrix for more
efficient calculations. When matrix is broken down into eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, the basis becomes just scaling, no shear, rotation, or
stretch.</p>
<h4 id="eigenvector">Eigenvector</h4>
<p>Eigenvectors point in the directions that are preserved (or exactly
reversed) by a linear transformation. While most vectors change both
magnitude and direction when transformed, eigenvectors only change in
magnitude by a factor equal to their corresponding eigenvalue.</p>
<h4 id="eigenvalue">Eigenvalue</h4>
<p>Eigenvalues indicate how much the eigenvectors are stretched as a
result of the linear transformation. If the eigenvalue is 1 then there
is no change, 0 means the eigenvector becomes the zero vector and
reduces the dimensionality of the vector space. The number of zero
eigenvalues indicates how much the dimensionality of the vector space is
reduced.</p>

<p>Matrix decomposition breaks a matrix down into multiple factors, much
like factoring an equation. The resulting components can describe
characteristics of the matrix, as well as make some calculations more
efficient.</p>
