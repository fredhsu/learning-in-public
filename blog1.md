# Learning Math for AI

As part of my AI and ML journey, I feel the need to strengthen my mathematical knowledge. The relevant math topics seem to be:

1. Linear Algebra
2. Multivariate Calculus
3. Probability and Statistics

I'll start with Linear Algebra, a topic I never actually took in college. I'm drawing upon three different resources for now, but I may explore some others if I decide to go deeper:

1. Math for ML
2. Math of ML
3. Videos from 3 Blue 1 Brown

If I decide to go deeper I'm eyeing these resources:

1. MIT OCW Linear Algebra
2. Linear Algebra the right way

I'm will leverage LLMs to help answer questions and clarify ideas as I go along in lieu of having a professor/TA to ask (I suppose I could also try to be more social and post to Discord channels).

As I collect my notes I'm publishing them here as a reference and will try to add some additional thoughts and commentary as I go along.
