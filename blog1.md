As I've started learning more about AI and ML, I've often heard its a good idea to become familiar with the underlying math. I've always been a fan of math so I'm looking forward to learning/relearning math concepts as they pertain to AI. The key subjects seem to be:

1. Linear Algebra
2. Multivariate Calculus
3. Probability and Statistics

I'm starting with Linear Algebra, a topic I never actually took in college. I'm drawing upon three different resources for now, but I may explore some others if I decide to go deeper:

1. Math for ML
2. Math of ML
3. Videos from 3 Blue 1 Brown

Of course I'm open to leveraging LLMs to help answer questions and clarify ideas as I go along.

As I collect my notes I'm publishing them here as a reference and will try to add some additional thoughts and commentary as I go along.
